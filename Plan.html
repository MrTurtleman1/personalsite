        Gameplay
        At each unlock you get an emotoken and at the second you get an amulet that lets you use more than one token at once, and challenges to get one more of each token.

        Emotions
        Neutral
        Just regular
        Angry
        Gets fire powers. He can create a burst of fire around that melts stuff and burns stuff.
        Sad
        Gets water powers. He can shoot tears from his eyes that act like projectiles. 
        Scared
        Gets rock powers. He can scream. The scream pushes objects, even big ones, and it can break small objects.
        Happy
        Gets wind powers. He can double jump.
        He does this using the emotokens.
        <!--Make sure to word these better, espescially wind.-->

      <h3>Story</h3>
      <p>
        At the beginning of the game Imopo is being made fun of. He runs away and climbs a mountain. The tutorial takes place on this mountain. The top of the mountain is too foggy for him to see anything, but he hears some voices. He is convinced to go home.
        While trying to go back he falls into a river and ends up in the Noxious Swamp. He goes through the swamp and near the end he finds a cage. He tries to approach the cage but something comes up from the water.
