      <h3>Story</h3>
      <p>
        At the beginning of the game Imopo is being made fun of. He runs away and climbs a mountain. The tutorial takes place on this mountain. The top of the mountain is too foggy for him to see anything, but he hears some voices. He is convinced to go home.
        While trying to go back he falls into a river and ends up in the Noxious Swamp. He goes through the swamp and near the end he finds a cage. He tries to approach the cage but something comes up from the water.
        <!--Here is the rest, that's just all I made legible.-->
